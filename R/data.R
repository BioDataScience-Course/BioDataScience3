#' Rice Dataset Commeo and Osmancik
#'
#' A total of 3810 rice grain's images were taken for the two species (Cammeo and Osmancik),
#' processed and feature inferences were made. Seven morphological features were obtained for each grain of rice.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 8 variables and 3810 observations:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{area}}{The  number  of  pixels  within  the boundaries of the rice grain.}
#'   \item{\code{perimeter}}{The perimeter of the rice grain.}
#'   \item{\code{major_axis_length}}{The longest line that can be drawn on the rice  grain.}
#'   \item{\code{minor_axis_length}}{The shortest line that can be drawn on the rice  grain.}
#'   \item{\code{eccentricity}}{It measures how round the ellipse, which has  the  same  moments  as  the  rice  grain, is.}
#'   \item{\code{convex_area}}{The the  pixel  count  of  the  smallest convex shell of the region formed by the rice grain.}
#'   \item{\code{extent}}{the ratio of the region formed by the rice grain to the bounding box pixels.}
#'   \item{\code{class}}{A **factor** with two levels: `"Cammeo"`, and `"Osmancik"`.}
